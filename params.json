Currently it supports ABX and MUSHRA style test procedures but can be easily extended to other test schemes.\r\n\r\nTo get a better impression about its functionality there are two demo test sites for ABX and MUSHRA test:\r\n\r\n* http://hsu-ant.github.io/beaqlejs/demo/abx/\r\n* http://hsu-ant.github.io/beaqlejs/demo/mushra/\r\n\r\nBeaqleJS has been presented at the [Linux Audio Conference 2014](http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2014/) at the ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany. The [paper](http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2014/papers/26.pdf) and presentation [slides](http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2014/download/SKraft_BeaqleJS.pdf) are available from the conference archive.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nhttp://hsu-ant.github.io/beaqlejs\r\n\r\nskraft (AT) hsu-hh.de\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThe complete sources, html and script files as well as images are released unter the *GPLv3 \r\nlicense*.
